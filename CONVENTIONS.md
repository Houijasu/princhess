## Commit Messages

  * Princhess uses emoji log for commit messages. This means commit messages should be prefixed by:
    * 📦 NEW: when you add something entirely new
    * 👌 IMP: when you improve/enhance a piece of code, like refactoring
    * 🐛 FIX: when you fix a bug
    * 📖 DOC: when you add or update documentation
    * 🤖 TST: when you add or update tests
  * Commit messages should be:
      * Imperative. Write commit messages as if you are giving an order,
        e.g. "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature".
      * Actions. Make commit messages based on the actions you take
      * Concise. Keep commit messages short and to the point, ideally under 50 characters.
